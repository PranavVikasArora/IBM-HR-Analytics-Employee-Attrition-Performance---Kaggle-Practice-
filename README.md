Note- There are a few mistakes in the notebook
1. The imbalance in the data set has not been handled
2. The accuracy of the model was looked at instead of the F1 score as a measure of success( Random forest had low f1 score, could have been improved by hyperparamter tuning or other ML models, data cleaning/processing techniques, stats, etc)


This code was just for practice, don't use this as a proper refrence. Also,the data in some columns might vary a little
Problem Statement - 
Uncover the factors that lead to employee attrition and explore important questions such as ‘show me a breakdown of distance from home by job role and attrition’ or ‘compare average monthly income by education and attrition’. This is a fictional data set created by IBM data scientists.
